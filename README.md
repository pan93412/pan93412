I am a backend intern at [Zeabur](https://github.com/zeabur) and an undergraduate based in Taiwan 🇹🇼. I design, translate, and occasionally contribute to open-source software (OSS).

GitHub is my primary platform for sharing my work. I have pinned some projects that I am proud of, and you can find more in my repositories and my teams.
